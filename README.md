My first task as intern in PRODIGY INFOTECH.

Task about:
Creating a python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allowing user to input a messsage and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

**Caesae Cipher**

This program a simple CaesarCipher algorithm in Python programming language. The Caesar Cipher algorithm is used for encryption and decryption of text or message. Here every letter of text or message is shifted by fixed number of positions defined by user as shift value.

**Features**

* Encryption: Shift every letter of input text and convert the entire text into encrypted form based on defined shift value.

* Decryption: Reverse the encrypted text into original text or message using shift value.

**Usage**

1.Execute Python programming script and follow the sintax.

2.User inputs:
* Choice of Encryption or Decryption.
* User defined coustume message or text.
* User define shift value.
